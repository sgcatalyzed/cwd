# tree

A versioned and merklized key-value store, based on a radix tree data structure.

_Versioned_ means it allows queries under historical states (provided they have not been pruned). _Merklized_ means it is capable of generating Merkle proofs to demontrate that certain key-value pairs exist or do not exist in the tree.

`Tree` works similarly as common storage primitives provided by [cw-storage-plus](https://github.com/CosmWasm/cw-storage-plus), such as `Item`, `Map`, and `IndexedMap`. It can be declared as a constant:

```rust
use tree::Tree;

const TREE: Tree<Vec<u8>, Vec<u8>> = Tree::new_default();
```

`Tree` offers a minimal API:

| method    | description                                                                   |
| --------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `apply`   | perform a batch insertion or deletion operations                              |
| `prune`   | delete nodes that are not longer part of the tree since a given version       |
| `root`    | query the root node hash                                                      |
| `get`     | query the value associated with the given key, optionally with a Merkle proof |
| `iterate` | enumerate key-value pairs stored in the tree                                  |

## Comparison with alternative solutions

Whereas [IAVL](https://github.com/cosmos/iavl) and [Merk](https://github.com/turbofish-org/merk) are binary search trees, this work is a 16-ary radix tree, similar to Ethereum's Patricia Merkle tree (PMT) and [Diem's Jellyfish Merkle tree (JMT)](https://github.com/diem/diem/tree/latest/storage/jellyfish-merkle).

Compared to PMT and JMT, we made a few adjustments:

- **Whereas PMT/JMT hashes keys, we use raw keys.** This is necessary to allow iteration (e.g. "what is the very next key in the tree after the key `abc`?"). Using raw keys increases complexity because 1) keys can be of variable length, and 2) internal nodes may also have values. This said, I think it's worth it because iteration is such a powerful feature for smart contract development that (in EVM, you can't even do simple things like listing all holders of an ERC20 because of the lack of iteration).

- **Whereas PMT/JMT does not support deleting, we do.** The EVM doesn't support deleting keys. If you use Solidity's `delete` keyword, what it actually does is to set the storage slot to a default value such as `0`, `false`, or `""`. I'm not sure about Move but my guess is it's the same. This is really bad, because if, say, there is a `0` at a certain storage slot, the contract can't tell if it's that the value doesn't exist, or that the value exists and it's a zero. This can open security holes if the developer fails to pay attention. In CWD, we definitely want to support deleting keys.

- **We simplified the node structure.** PMT has 4 node types: internal, leaf, extension, and null. JMT got rid of extension. In this work, we reduce this to only one single node type, which simplifies logics in many cases.

The following table summarizes features supported by various state commitment schemes:

|                               | IAVL | Merk | JMT | this work |
| ----------------------------- | ---- | ---- | --- | --------- |
| stable rust implementation    | ❌    | ❌    | ✅   | ✅         |
| batched ops                   | ❌    | ✅    | ✅   | ✅         |
| deletion                      | ✅    | ✅    | ❌   | ✅         |
| iteration                     | ✅    | ✅    | ❌   | ✅         |
| O(1) read                     | ❌    | ✅    | ❌   | ❌         |
| historical query              | ✅    | ❌    | ✅   | ✅         |
| merkle proof                  | ✅    | ✅    | ✅   | ✅         |
| insertion order indepdendence | ❌    | ❌    | ✅   | ✅         |

The only feature this work misses out is O(1) read, which I think is mutually exclusive with historical queries (see note below). For use in blockchains, historical queries seem to be more important, so we're willing to make this tradeoff.

Note - You can either index a key by `version || bytes` which gives you historical queries but no O(1) reads, or by the raw `bytes` which gives you O(1) reads but no historical queries. Or you can have two stores, one indexing by raw bytes and the other versioned (similar to Osmosis' [fastnode](https://github.com/cosmos/iavl/pull/468) improvement to IAVL), so you get both, but at the tradeoff of doubling disk usage. An alternative is to use the underlying DB's timestamping feature (which is what both [Merk's doc](https://github.com/turbofish-org/merk/blob/develop/docs/algorithms.md) and [ADR-065](https://github.com/cosmos/cosmos-sdk/blob/main/docs/architecture/adr-065-store-v2.md) suggest) but that's only O(1) from the tree's perspective; the underlying DB still needs to do the timestamping stuff which is not O(1). So in summary, you can't get both historical query and O(1) read.
